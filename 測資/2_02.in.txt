Fairy Tale Story #2: 
3
Beauty and the Beast
5
No plot could be more romantic than this one: A kind and virtuous Beauty offers herself as a hostage
6
to free her father from the castle of a fearsome
7
Beast. When she falls in love with the Beast despite his outward appearance, he's transformed into a
5
handsome Prince.

Who among us has not felt unworthy
7
of a lover yet longed to have our inner value recognized?
5
Who has not dreamed of romantic love with the power to redeem and transform?
3
No wonder "Beauty and the Beast," originally a French story, is the second most frequently visited
9
fairy tales for kids on Sur La Lune Fairy Tales.
0
Of all the many retellings, our favorite is probably
5
French director Jean Cocteau's surreal 1945 film
7
version La Belle et la BÃªte, but the Disney version is certainly the most prevalent (and lucrative).
9
So far Beauty and the Beast has rung the company's cash register as a cartoon,
9
a Broadway musical, a soundtrack album, and, most recently, a live-action film with Emma Watson.
0
It's also spawned innumerable related merchandise items such as
0
Disney's Enchanted Rose Jewelry Box, princess-pink sheet sets from Target emblazoned
1
with the motto "Beauty is Found Within," and ornately cut gold foil B&B-inspired wedding
1
invitations from an Etsy store called Shimmering Ceremony.

Did you know that you can even
5
buy Disney wedding gowns?

Fairy Tale Story #3 Little Red Riding Hood
7
Though the story was probably intended as a warning for children to follow directions,the rebellious
8
character of Little Red Riding Hood is the most modern of the fairy tale heroines we've met so far.
4
In this fairy tale for kids,
5
Red sets off alone to visit her grandmother with instructions not to step off the forest path
7
advice she promptly disregards, attracting the attention of a talking
4
wolf who sets out to eat and impersonate Grandma. What happens next depends
2
on what you read. In the 17th-century French version recorded by Charles Perrault,
6
Red gets gobbled up by the wolf. The End. In other tellings, across Europe, North America,
8
China, Japan, and Ghana, she's saved at the last minute by a guy with an axe,
9
or the wolf chokes on her hood, or he eats both Grandma and Red
5
but is forced to vomit
2
them up unharmed.
4
Naturally, bold, independent Red has continued to attract fans:
6
The 19th-century English novelist Charles Dickens
7
called her his "first love,"
8
saying of his childhood, "I felt if I could have married
1
Little Red Riding-Hood, I should have known perfect bliss."
8
Of the many recent retellings on page and screen,
3
our favorite is the animated film Hoodwinked!
4
with Anne Hathaway voicing a wonderfully sassy,
6
attitudinal Red.

Fairy tale books like this one always make great movies and shows.
