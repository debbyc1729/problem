"Cinderella" is one example of classic fairy tales for kids. Once there was a hardworking girl withi

This is the fantasy that just won't quit. Apparently "the Cinderella area of [Sur La Lune] rece

modern retellings including Walt Disney's iconic 1950 cartoon, the block

Why are teenagers obessed with zombies and vampire?
8
Our current preoccupation with zombies and vampires is easy to explain.
3
They're two sides of the
4
same coin, addressing our fascination with sex, death and food. They're both

undead, they bot

gue and they can both be killed with specialis

But they seem to have become
1
polarised. Vampires are the undead of choice for girls, and
0
zombies for boys. Vampires
4
are cool,
2
aloof, beautiful, brooding creatures of the night. Typical moody
4
teenage boys, basically.
6
Zombies a

re dumb, brutal, ugly and mindlessly violent. Which makes them
7
Also like typical teenage boys, I suppose.
